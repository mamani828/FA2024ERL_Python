Log October 22:
    - Started adding some buttons to the cylinder pybullet, and able to control the velocity with a slider
    - Aiming to finish making a p2p program and PIDS in pybullet
Log November 8th:
    - Made a new more detailed plan
    - removed the pyqt stuff
    - made a req.txt for easier installation in the future
    For setup to get done by next week:
        - Get the CylPybulletnopyqt.py running for the whole team
        - Get the PID working to change the object/robot position
        - Find an alternative to pyqt for logging(maybe even in a text file for time being)
        - Change the Cylinder to a robot and possibly add a pid for heading and slider for angular velocity
