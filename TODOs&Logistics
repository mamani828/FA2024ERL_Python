Coordinate with team to come up with a plan to be able to design an interactive and customizable camera tool with explanations, think of a narrative that would be a
good story to tell to the learner, during this project always keep in mind you are making a tutorial!!! The goal is to teach, not only develop.

For now, this would be the backbone infrastructre that we can use for general tutorial applicaitons, come up wth a plan to create this tool.
Keep in mind, since this is infrastrcutre really, it is very very very important that it is as modular and flexible as possible, if we plan right now, later on life would be easier.
